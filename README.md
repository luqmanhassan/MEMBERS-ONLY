# The Ape Club - Documentation

## About This Project

This web app hosts an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside this clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

## Frameworks

This project was built using Node/Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and the EJS template engine.

## What I learned

This project has afforded me the opportunity to work on my authentication skills with Express. I used Passport.js (passport-local strategy) to implement a secure form of user authentication while also working on my database skills with MongoDB.
